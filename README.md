# CSM Voice Chat Assistant

A web-based voice assistant built with [Controllable Speech Model (CSM)](https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm) for high-quality, natural-sounding speech and a simple text interface.

## Features

- üó£Ô∏è High-quality speech synthesis with CSM
- üîÑ Multiple voice options (8 different voices)
- üí¨ Interactive chat interface
- üì± Modern, responsive UI
- üéõÔ∏è Simple REST API for chat interactions
- üîå Optional Socket.IO for real-time streaming (recommended)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for faster performance)

### Setup

1. Clone the CSM repository and set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm.git
cd csm
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flask python-dotenv flask-socketio==5.3.4
```

## Running the Application

### Standard Version

Run the application with the standard REST-based interface:

```bash
start.bat  # On Windows
./start.sh  # On Linux/Mac
```

### Socket.IO Version (Recommended)

For a better experience with real-time streaming:

```bash
start_socketio.bat  # On Windows
./start_socketio.sh  # On Linux/Mac
```

Then visit: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the `.env` file:

```
# Required environment variable for torch
NO_TORCH_COMPILE=1

# Application settings
PORT=5000
HOST=127.0.0.1
DEBUG=True

# Voice settings
SPEAKER_ID=0  # 0-13 for different voices
MAX_AUDIO_LENGTH=5000  # Maximum audio length in milliseconds
CHUNK_SIZE=60  # Text chunk size for speech generation
```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000
2. You'll be greeted with a welcome message
3. Type a message in the text box and press Send or hit Enter
4. The assistant will respond with both text and speech
5. You can change voices using the dropdown menu
6. Click the "Clear Chat" button to start a new conversation

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Playing

Modern browsers require user interaction before playing audio. If you don't hear any voice:
- Click anywhere on the page to enable audio
- Make sure your browser's audio is not muted
- Try reducing the `MAX_AUDIO_LENGTH` in the `.env` file if you encounter errors

### Memory Issues

If you experience out-of-memory errors:
- Reduce `MAX_AUDIO_LENGTH` in the `.env` file (default: 5000ms)
- Use smaller `CHUNK_SIZE` values (default: 60 characters)
- Close other GPU-intensive applications

### Socket.IO Version

If the Socket.IO version isn't working:
- Make sure you have the correct version of Flask-SocketIO: `pip install flask-socketio==5.3.4`
- Check that you're using the correct HTML template for Socket.IO

## Implementation Details

The application is built with:

- **Flask**: Web framework
- **CSM**: Controllable Speech Model for high-quality voice synthesis
- **Socket.IO** (optional): For real-time streaming communication
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend UI with modern design

The system processes text in small chunks to provide a more responsive experience and handles errors gracefully to prevent crashes during speech generation.
