# Kyutai Mimi and Moshi Integration Research

## Overview

Based on the feedback, we need to consider integrating CSM with more advanced audio codec systems:

1. [**Mimi**](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi): A streaming neural audio codec
2. [**Moshi**](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi): A full-duplex spoken dialogue framework

## Key Components & Technologies

### Mimi Audio Codec

- Processes 24 kHz audio
- Downsamples to 12.5 Hz representation
- Low bandwidth (1.1 kbps)
- Fully streaming manner with 80ms latency
- Outperforms other codecs like SpeechTokenizer and SemantiCodec

### Moshi Dialogue Framework

- Models dual audio streams (system and user)
- Predicts both speech and inner monologue text tokens
- Architecture:
  - Depth Transformer: Models inter-codebook dependencies
  - Temporal Transformer: 7B parameter model for temporal dependencies
- Achieves 160-200ms theoretical latency

## Integration Strategy

To properly integrate these advanced technologies with our CSM implementation, we need to:

1. **Research both frameworks in depth** to understand their APIs and requirements
2. **Build a layered architecture** that can support:
   - Real-time audio processing
   - Streaming text generation
   - Low-latency responses
   - Full-duplex dialogue

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Initial Research**:
   - Study Mimi API and model capabilities
   - Analyze Moshi architecture and requirements
   - Understand how they can complement CSM's capabilities

2. **Development Plan**:
   - Create adapter layers for Mimi audio codec integration
   - Build a pipeline connecting CSM with Moshi for dialogue management
   - Implement streaming capabilities to reduce latency

3. **Production Requirements**:
   - Comprehensive testing framework
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Deployment configuration

## Research Questions

1. How compatible is CSM with Mimi/Moshi architectures?
2. What are the hardware requirements for running the full stack?
3. What latency can we achieve in a production environment?
4. How can we build a testing framework that validates the entire pipeline?

## Resources to Study
